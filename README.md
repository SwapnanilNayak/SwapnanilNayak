### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>
I'm from Kolkata,India. I have a passion for working with hardware. When I'm not working on projects, I enjoy making games as a hobby. I love being able to combine my technical skills with my creative interests, and I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and learn more. Whether I'm designing complex systems or tinkering with new hardware, I'm always driven by a desire to push boundaries and create something truly innovative.</p>
